Task: Questionnaire

Your task is to create a questionnaire using html, css and js if needed. You can fetch data for questions using [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). Be sure to make it available on the internet for your peers and teachers to be able to access it after it is finalized. Here is a wireframe for reference for the design of the app: [https://app.uizard.io/p/92e86c15](questionnaire wireframe).
!Note: Please after youâ€™ve completed the task reach out to me in the Discrod DMs, put there a link to your deployed website and a repository/code sandbox for me to review the code.

Requirements:

1. Data for questions should be fetched from [Open Trivia](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).
2. Your app should provide 5 - 10 questions in 1 session.
3. You have to use HTML and CSS in your app.
4. App must be available on the internet. You could either use [https://codesandbox.io/s/css-r1e41?file=/src/styles.css:1046-1065](code sandbox) or if you are planning to make a project locally you will have 

to deploy it yourself. Here are some deployment platforms: [github pages](https://pages.github.com), [netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
+If you are already familiar with frond end frameworks you could make your app on vue, angular or react. You are also free to use css pre-processors, bootstrap, styled components or jss.
